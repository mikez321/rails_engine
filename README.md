# RAILS ENGINE

## About
Rails engine is a Turing project from the Back End cirriculum and was done as a solo assignment.  It was used as an intro to building a Rails API, using namespaced/versioned routes, serializers, as well as for practice with ActiveRecord.  The original project can be found [here](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine/).  Rails Engine endpoints were tested against the Rails Driver which would be a theoretical front end of the application.  In case you're interested in this front end, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver).
